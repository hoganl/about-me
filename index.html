    <h2>A Little Bit About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Lacy Hogan. I hope you enjoyed my fun quiz. Now to learn a little bit more about who I am. <br><br>I was born and raised in Vacaville, CA. I enjoy performing in thearter. I started when I was in elemetary school and still do to this day. I graducated High School in 2001 and began junior college. In August 2003, when I was 20-years-old, I enlisted the United States Air Force. I graduated technical school for Contracting in December 2003. For my first duty station, I spent three years in Aviano, Italy at Aviano AFB. In January 2004, I was stationed in Tampa, FL at MacDill AFB where I spent another two years in active duty service. In September 2008, I separated from active duty and crossed over to the Air National Gaurd. I spent just under three years with guard before switching over to Air Force Reserves. I am still presently enlisted in the reserves. In addition to military experience as a contracting officer and contract specilaist, I have also worked in several defense contractor positions as contract subject matter expert.
